CHANGELOG

v1.12.4 - 2025-11-16

Changed:

- Linting fixes for twofactor that were previously masked.

v1.12.3 erroneously tagged and pushed

v1.12.2 - 2025-11-16

Changed:

- add rsc.io/qr dependency for twofactor.

v1.12.1 - 2025-11-16

Changed:
- twofactor: Remove go.{mod,sum}.

v1.12.0 - 2025-11-16

Added
- twofactor: the github.com/kisom/twofactor repo has been subtree'd
  into this repo.

v1.11.2 - 2025-11-16

Changed
- cmd/ski, cmd/csrpubdump, cmd/tlskeypair: centralize
  certificate/private-key/CSR parsing by reusing certlib helpers.
  This reduces duplication and improves consistency across commands.
- csr: CSR parsing in the above commands now uses certlib.ParseCSR,
  which verifies CSR signatures (behavioral hardening compared to
  prior parsing without signature verification).

v1.11.0 - 2025-11-15

Added
- cache/mru: introduce MRU cache implementation with timestamp utilities.

Changed
- certlib: complete overhaul to simplify APIs and internals.
- repo: widespread linting cleanups across many packages (config, dbg, die,
  fileutil, log/logging, mwc, sbuf, seekbuf, tee, testio, etc.).
- cmd: general program cleanups; `cert-bundler` lint fixes.

Removed
- rand: remove unused package.
- testutil: remove unused code.
