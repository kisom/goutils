Unreleased - 2025-11-15

"Error handling modernization" (in progress)

- Introduced typed, wrapped errors via certlib/certerr.Error (Source, Kind, Op, Err) with Unwrap.
- Standardized helper constructors: DecodeError, ParsingError, VerifyError, LoadingError.
- Preserved sentinel errors (e.g., ErrEncryptedPrivateKey, ErrInvalidPEMType, ErrEmptyCertificate) for errors.Is.
- Refactored certlib to use certerr in key paths (CSR parsing/verification, PEM cert pool, certificate read/load).
- Migrated logging/file.go and cmd/kgz away from github.com/pkg/errors to stdlib wrapping.
- Removed dependency on github.com/pkg/errors; ran go mod tidy.
- Added package docs for certerr and a README section on error handling and matching.
- Added unit tests for certerr (Is/As and message formatting).

Planned next steps:
- Continue refactoring remaining error paths for consistent wrapping.
- Add focused tests for key flows (encrypted private key, CSR invalid PEM types, etc.).
- Run golangci-lint (errorlint, errcheck) and address findings.
