kgz

kgz is like gzip, but supports compressing and decompressing to a different
directory than the source file is in.

Usage: kgz [-l] source [target]

If target is a directory, the basename of the sourcefile will be used
as the target filename. Compression and decompression is selected
based on whether the source filename ends in ".gz".

Flags:
	-l level	Compression level (0-9). Only meaninful when
			    compressing a file.
    -u          Do not restrict the size during decompression. As
                a safeguard against gzip bombs, the maximum size
                allowed is 32 * the compressed file size.
