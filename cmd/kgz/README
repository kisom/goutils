kgz

kgz is like gzip, but supports compressing and decompressing to a different
directory than the source file is in.

Usage: kgz [-l] [-k] [-m] [-x] [--uid N] [--gid N] source [target]

If target is a directory, the basename of the source file will be used
as the target filename. Compression and decompression is selected
based on whether the source filename ends in ".gz".

Flags:
	-l level    Compression level (0-9). Only meaningful when compressing.
    -u          Do not restrict the size during decompression. As
                a safeguard against gzip bombs, the maximum size
                allowed is 32 * the compressed file size.
    -k          Keep the source file (do not remove it after successful
                compression or decompression).
    -m          On decompression, set the file mtime from the gzip header.
    -x          On compression, include uid/gid/mode/ctime in the gzip Extra
                field so that decompression can restore them. The Extra payload
                is an ASN.1 DER-encoded struct.
    --uid N     When used with -x, set UID in Extra to N (override source).
    --gid N     When used with -x, set GID in Extra to N (override source).

Metadata notes:
- mtime is stored in the standard gzip header and restored with -m.
- uid/gid/mode/ctime are stored in a kgz-specific Extra subfield as an ASN.1
  DER-encoded struct. Restoring
  uid/gid may fail without sufficient privileges; such errors are ignored.
